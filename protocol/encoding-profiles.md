# StationConnect encoding profile negotiation

Each StationConnect workstation bookmark stores one capture source and one
complete encoding profile. The profile fixes the encoder backend, codec,
precision, chroma sampling, range, and color transform. The client advertises
exactly the saved format and the host must either acknowledge and produce that
same tuple or reject the launch. Neither side silently substitutes a different
backend or format.

| Capture source | Bookmark profile | Backend | Video format | Chroma | Depth | Color transform |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| NvFBC 8-bit | H.264 8-bit 4:2:2 | `software-cuda` | `0x0002` | 4:2:2 | 8 | Full-range BT.709 YCbCr |
| NvFBC 8-bit | H.264 8-bit 4:4:4 | `software-cuda` | `0x0004` | 4:4:4 | 8 | Identity GBR |
| NvFBC 8-bit | H.264 10-bit 4:2:2 | `software-cuda` | `0x0010` | 4:2:2 | 10 | Full-range BT.709 YCbCr; 8-bit source up-converted |
| NvFBC 8-bit | H.264 10-bit 4:4:4 | `software-cuda` | `0x0008` | 4:4:4 | 10 | Identity GBR; 8-bit source up-converted |
| NvFBC 8-bit | H.264 8-bit 4:4:4 NVENC | `nvenc-direct` | `0x0004` | 4:4:4 | 8 | Identity GBR |
| NvFBC 8-bit | H.265 8-bit 4:4:4 NVENC | `nvenc-direct` | `0x0400` | 4:4:4 | 8 | Identity GBR |
| NvFBC 8-bit | H.265 10-bit 4:4:4 NVENC | `nvenc-direct` | `0x0800` | 4:4:4 | 10 | Identity GBR; 8-bit source up-converted |
| Native X11/XShm 10-bit (Experimental) | H.264 10-bit 4:4:4 — x264 | `software-cuda` | `0x0008` | 4:4:4 | 10 | Identity GBR |
| Native X11/XShm 10-bit (Experimental) | H.265 10-bit 4:4:4 NVENC | `nvenc-direct` | `0x0800` | 4:4:4 | 10 | Identity GBR |

Identity GBR is full range with `matrix_coefficients=0`, `Y=G`, `U=B`, and
`V=R`; no YCbCr matrix conversion is applied. Native X11/XShm 10-bit capture
never offers an 8-bit profile. The qualified H.264 10-bit 4:4:4 software path
remains the default. Native X11/XShm 10-bit capture retains its Experimental
designation; NVENC is identified as the encoder backend rather than labeled as
an experimental encoding profile.

The historical `software-cuda` wire token names the shared software-encoder
backend and remains protocol-stable. For Native X11/XShm capture, the packed
RGB10 image is already in CPU memory: the host converts it directly into
x264's planar GBR10 input. If the negotiated encode size differs from the X11
canvas, the same CPU pass performs center-aligned bilinear scaling and GBR10
plane generation; the frame is not copied to CUDA and back. The host advertises
this mode only after its encoder probe produces an H.264 High 4:4:4 Predictive
10-bit SPS with full-range identity GBR color metadata.

For the NvFBC HEVC 10-bit NVENC tuple, CUDA expands each 8-bit BGRA component
to the MSB-aligned 10-bit identity plane before NVENC. This preserves all 256
source code values and gives the 10-bit transform/quantization pipeline more
headroom, but it does not claim native 10-bit capture precision. H.264 10-bit
NVENC is not offered because the qualified Ampere and Turing hosts do not
support it.

`tests/protocol/nvfbc-hevc10-nvenc-v1.json` is the exact negotiation and
pipeline test vector for this tuple. Hosts must reject it when feature `0x2000`
is absent or when the direct NVENC HEVC Rext 10-bit 4:4:4 probe fails.

Decoder choice is internal and profile-specific. The client attempts a real
exact-format hardware test frame first, validates decoded bit depth, chroma
geometry, full-range identity metadata, and renderer import, then falls back to
FFmpeg software decoding of the same bookmark format. It never changes codec,
depth, or chroma to make a hardware probe succeed. On the qualified Intel NUC:

- H.264 4:4:4 profiles use software decode because the iHD VA-API driver does
  not expose an H.264 4:4:4 decode profile.
- H.265 8-bit 4:4:4 may use VA-API Main 4:4:4 with an AYUV surface imported as
  packed RGB and identity-channel reordered in the presentation shader.
- H.265 10-bit 4:4:4 may use VA-API Main 4:4:4 10 with a Y410 surface imported
  as XR30.

If an exact hardware path fails its test frame or import gate, the client uses
the exact software decoder. If both exact paths fail, the connection fails
with a clear unsupported-profile error.
