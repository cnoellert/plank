# Platform boundaries

| Product | Platform | Source | Package integration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Host | Rocky/RHEL Linux, NVIDIA | `apps/host/linux` | `packaging/host/linux` |
| Host | macOS 27+, Apple Silicon | `apps/host/macos` | `packaging/host/macos` |
| Client | Ubuntu Linux | `apps/client` | `packaging/client/linux` |
| Client | macOS 27+, Apple Silicon | `apps/client` | Client DMG packaging script |

macOS qualification is tracked separately from Linux; beta OS results require
revalidation on the final release. See [acceptance criteria](acceptance-criteria.md)
and the product plans. Windows Host/Client remain future work. Do not create
empty platform trees or claim support before implementing and validating them.

Root CMake builds qualification tools and tests, not every product. Linux-only
hardware dependencies are optional there; product binaries retain their existing
native build systems. Use [build runbooks](build/) for actual packages.
