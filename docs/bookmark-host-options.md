# Host-aware bookmark options and Mac display matching

Branch: `bookmark-host-options`, based on accepted main `d6c4598`.

## Scope

Enable Match client display(s) for the existing macOS Host, and filter Add/Edit
capture and encoding choices by a reachable Host's advertised capabilities.
This is a Client-only change. No Host, input, media, transport or decoder
policy change is required.

## Behavior

- Public PLANK metadata identifies the supported Linux/Mac contract. It is
  only a UI hint, never authentication, certificate trust or exact-format proof.
- Address entry is debounced; at most one fast-fail lookup runs at a time.
  Stale replies cannot filter another address or a closed dialog.
- Known Linux Hosts show NvFBC/native-X11 and their existing encoding models.
  Known Macs show ScreenCaptureKit and the two Apple VideoToolbox profiles.
  Unreachable, unknown and unsupported Hosts retain all manual choices.
- Mac bookmarks preserve either Match client display(s) or a fixed resolution.
  Existing fixed bookmarks remain fixed. Filtering does not rewrite bookmarks
  until the operator saves them.
- At authentication, Qt screen geometry and device pixel ratio resolve the
  native-pixel request without initializing SDL/window surfaces. The existing
  authenticated display schema 2 requests that size and the selected profile.
  Before launch, SDL's actual display modes must agree; a topology change fails
  clearly instead of launching mis-scaled video/input.
- One or two horizontally arranged client monitors map to one Mac virtual
  canvas. The existing qualified resolutions and 5120x2160 maximum apply.
  Unsupported combinations require a fixed resolution; there is no silent
  downscale, arbitrary-resolution extension or new dual-Mac-output feature.
- Reconnect uses the same native-client canvas and existing authenticated
  generation/profile validation. Linux Match Client behavior is unchanged.

## Validation and next step

linux-client-builder Qt6.10.2: topology suite 16 tests pass; shared QML capture chooser
suite 3 tests pass. Coverage includes native4K/5K, 125%/200% logical geometry,
two2560x2160 screens, oversized/stacked/empty layouts, supported/unknown feature
contracts, delayed stale discovery replies and offline/manual choices.
These are automated logical/QML checks, not physical-monitor acceptance.

Intermediate1.0.65 clean compile/package gates pass. Review adds queued local
authentication-error completion (preserving the caller's asynchronous UI
contract) and a locked copy of authenticated geometry. The final candidate
advances to1.0.66;1.0.65 is internal validation only, not the handoff package.
The actual NvComputer persistence/parser test also passes, preserving Match
and fixed layout, both Apple profiles and independent profile bitrates.

The shared-selector label gate now follows PlankCaptureSourceBox.qml and
requires both dialogs to use that component. The new QML/topology/persistence
tests are part of normal Client package preflight.

The clean1.0.66-bookmark-host-options Client package is built and retained with
its checksum in artifacts/packages. Source root f7832bfd50cc0816e92cbe2ae85609818cd2eb03,
Client a803e0dc6d2e0846d4153d0a1c8dced8267fc39b. All package preflight, compile,
private runtime, manifest, version, dependency, logging and autostart-absence
gates pass. Existing FFmpeg deprecation/Quinn dead-code warnings remain.
Final packaged UI smoke passes real public Mac discovery, Add/Edit round-trip,
both Apple profile choices, Match/fixed controls and offline/manual selection.
No QML binding/type errors were recorded. Rendered screenshots were inspected;
they and build logs are in ignored build/bookmark-host-options-records.

No candidate was installed on a builder or End-User client. Development NUC
was unreachable (no route). No Host restart, authentication, stream or display
change was performed by the UI smoke test. Source remains locally committed
on the feature branches, not pushed/merged pending operator testing.

Next, manual acceptance: edit a Mac bookmark, choose Match client display(s), verify
native Host resolution and input mapping, reconnect, then verify a Linux
bookmark and offline creation. Existing1.0.64 Mac Host remains installed.

## Packaged UI smoke test

`tests/protocol/client-bookmark-ui-smoke.cpp` is a standalone Linux test-only
preload, never linked or shipped with the application. It opens the actual
packaged Add/Edit dialogs, queries a specified live Mac's public metadata,
checks filtered models and Match/fixed controls, and saves screenshots. It
creates one bookmark only inside explicitly isolated XDG paths; it never
authenticates or launches a stream. Compile with `g++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++17`
and the `Qt6Core Qt6Gui Qt6Quick Qt6Qml` pkg-config flags. Run the extracted
Client ELF with that library in LD_PRELOAD, `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`,
`QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software`, fresh XDG_CONFIG_HOME/XDG_STATE_HOME/XDG_CACHE_HOME
and a private0700 XDG_RUNTIME_DIR. Set PLANK_UI_SMOKE_HOST explicitly to the
authorized development Mac and PLANK_UI_SMOKE_DIR to the screenshot directory.
Keep a30-second external timeout. Never preload it into an installed/live
Client or use an existing user's settings.
